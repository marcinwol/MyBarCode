# mwbarcode

mwbarcode calculates a time based bar code of set of images.

# motivation

The project is inspired by [moviebarcodes](http://moviebarcode.tumblr.com). But instead of using movie frames, I want to use images. The reason is that these days its not uncommon to have hundreds or even thousands of images taken regularly using phones or camers. And I though it would be nice to have one representation of these photos, i.e. one image representing everthing.
